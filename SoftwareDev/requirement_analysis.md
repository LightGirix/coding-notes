# Requirement Analysis

The most important part before designing

Get Requirement --> **Requirement Analysis** --> Design

# Placeholder Title

## Incomplete Requirement
- Vague:
    - *placeholder*
        - placeholder
- Ambiguity: 
    - *Create database from related tables*
        - What is *related???*
- Validity: Requirement that required unauthorized access outside of available scope
    - *placeholder*
        - placeholder
### Type of question
- Open-ended: Freestyle answer
    - *What are your.....?*
- Close-ended: Choice
    - *You wanted..... right?*
    - *Why did you want this?*

## Operational Concept

### High Level (Client Side)
- Who?
    - Your position?
    - Your relation to this?
    - Your involvement on this?

- Why?
    - Necessary or not?
    - Improve something?

- How?
    - Workflow?
    - Access flow?

### Low Level (Dev Side)
- Development
    - Interface
    - Error Handling
    - Interpretability
    - Performance
    - Security
    - Compatibility

- Quality Assurance
    - Functionality
    - Resiliency
    - Interpretability
    - Usability
    - Data

- Training and support
    - Specific-requirement support

## Functional Design
**How will anyone understand your design?**

**Make an agreement contract about your functional design (FSD), to ensure any function outside of the design cannot be requested**

### Design Documentation
- Workflow: Explain how system works
- Objective: What does *this thing* do?
- Feature & Condition: Requirements for it to work
- Layout & Field: Formatting

Ex. User Manual, System Architecture, Tech Stack

## Non-requirement
Not in requirement, but is expected, or is a standard that should be achieved

- Performance: Response time, Max concurrent loads
- Security: XSS-proof
- Support & Software Consult
- Hardware Consult
- User privacy control
- Multilanguage support

**You must ask for these details!!!**
