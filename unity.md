Note: This isn't a note to teach you Unity basics, but a note to teach you about Unity Scripting in general. You should also have basics in C# (C Sharp)
before attempting to use this note on your own.

If you really don't know where to start, I suggest learning Python (for basics), then Java (to grasp OOP concepts), then C# (I have a note for transitioning from Java to C#), then Unity.

# MDA Framework

In game design, this is one of the foundational model used to analyze games based on its three components:
- Mechanics: **How does the game work?** How to play, Game rules, Game controls and actions, Winning conditon, Data Structures and Algorithms used to implement those.
- Dynamics: **What does the player do?** How do players interact with those mechanics? How do mechanics interact with each other?
- Aesthetic: **What does the player feel?** What kind of emotions does the game evoke?
