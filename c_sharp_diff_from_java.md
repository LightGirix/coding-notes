- [1. foreach](#1-foreach)

Note: I have studied Java before so if you've got no basics about C#, find a video to watch. This'll cover only the differences between C# and Java.
# 1. foreach
Is a range-based for loop in C# The syntax is in the following code:
```C#
String[] names = {"A", "B", "C"};

foreach (String name in names)
{
  Console.WriteLine(name);
}
```
Output
```
A
B
C
```
